# SQL Project - Books, Customers, and Orders Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset consisting of books, customers, and orders using SQL queries. The goal is to extract meaningful insights by performing operations such as filtering, aggregations, joins, and advanced SQL functions.

## 📂 Dataset
The project is based on three main CSV files:
- **Books.csv** - Contains details about books, including title, author, genre, and price.
- **Customers.csv** - Includes customer information such as ID, name, and location.
- **Orders.csv** - Records transactions, including order ID, customer ID, book ID, and purchase details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite/etc.)**
- **Jupyter Notebook (optional, if you used Python for additional analysis)**
- **Data Visualization (if applicable, mention tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Matplotlib)**

## 📜 SQL Queries Covered
The project includes a variety of SQL queries to solve different business problems. Some key queries include:
- **Data Cleaning** - Handling NULL values, duplicates, and formatting.
- **Joins** - Merging tables to retrieve meaningful insights.
- **Aggregations** - Summarizing sales data (e.g., total revenue, best-selling books).
- **Window Functions** - Ranking books based on sales.
- **Subqueries & CTEs** - Extracting complex insights.
- **Performance Optimization** - Indexing and query optimization techniques.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-project.git
   cd sql-project
   ```
2. Import the provided SQL scripts (`.sql` files) into your database.
3. Load the CSV files into the respective tables.
4. Execute the queries to analyze the dataset.

## 📊 Sample Insights
- **Top-selling books and genres**
- **Customers with the highest purchases**
- **Monthly revenue trends**
- **Average order value analysis**

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- Implement stored procedures and triggers.
- Use Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) for automation.
- Build a dashboard using Power BI/Tableau.
